> If you are coming from another programming language, this is a good resources. If you are new to programming, this book might throw you for a loop. 

## Up next?
I am looking forward to join the goland family. Learning the syntactic-styles, design patterns, etc. However, before any of that, I need to learning the Go fundamentals.
